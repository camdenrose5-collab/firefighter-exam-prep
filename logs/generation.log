  "question": "During a routine equipment check, Firefighter Miller consults the department's new SCBA maintenance protocol. The protocol states: 'All SCBA units require a Level 2 inspection weekly, which includes checking cylinder pressure, facepiece seal, and harness integrity. If cylinder pressure falls below 1900 PSI or if any component shows visible damage, the unit must be immediately tagged 'Out of Service' and reported to the Logistics Officer. Level 1 daily checks, focusing on a quick visual and pressure gauge verification, are still required before each shift.' Firefighter Miller is performing a Level 2 inspection and finds an SCBA unit with a cylinder pressure of 1850 PSI and a slightly frayed harness strap. According to the protocol, what is Firefighter Miller's immediate next step?",
  "options": [
    "A. Replace the cylinder and continue the inspection.",
    "B. Tag the unit 'Out of Service' and report it to the Logistics Officer.",
    "C. Perform a Level 1 daily check to confirm the findings.",
    "D. Continue using the unit but schedule it for repair next week."
  ],
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The protocol clearly states that if cylinder pressure falls below 1900 PSI (1850 PSI is below this threshold) OR if any component shows visible damage (a frayed harness strap), the unit must be 'immediately tagged 'Out of Service' and reported to the Logistics Officer.'

  "question": "A new recruit is reviewing a departmental memorandum regarding a revised procedure for apparatus checks. The memo states: \n\n\"MEMORANDUM: Daily Apparatus Check Protocol Revision - Effective 0600hrs, November 1st.\n\nAll personnel are advised of an update to the daily apparatus check procedure. Effective immediately, the standard 30-point checklist will be replaced by a new 45-point digital checklist accessible via the tablet mounted in each apparatus cab.

  "question": "Engine 7 is actively flowing water at a rate of 240 gallons per minute (GPM) onto a commercial building fire.

  "explanation": "First, calculate the water flowed during the initial 10 minutes: 240 GPM * 10 minutes = 2400 gallons.\nNext, calculate the 25% reduction in flow rate: 25% of 240 GPM = 0.25 * 240 GPM = 60 GPM.\nThe new, reduced flow rate is: 240 GPM - 60 GPM = 180 GPM.\nThen, calculate the water flowed during the additional 15 minutes at the reduced rate: 180 GPM * 15 minutes = 2700 gallons.\nFinally, add the two amounts to find the total volume: 2400 gallons + 2700 gallons = 5100 gallons.\n\nWait, let me re-check my math.

  "options": [
    "2 minutes",
    "3 minutes",
    "4 minutes",
    "5 minutes"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "3 minutes",
  "explanation": "First, calculate 40% of the tank's capacity: 0.40 * 750 gallons = 300 gallons. This is the amount of water that needs to be used. Next, divide the amount of water used by the flow rate: 300 gallons / 150 GPM = 2 minutes. Wait, I made a mistake in my thought process. Let me re-evaluate. The question asks '40% empty'. So, 40% of 750 gallons is 300 gallons. If 300 gallons are used, then 300 gallons / 150 GPM = 2 minutes. Let me re-check my mental math.

Okay, let's re-do the calculation for the explanation and ensure the correct answer matches.
Tank capacity: 750 gallons.
Flow rate: 150 GPM.
Question: How many minutes until the tank is 40% empty?

1.  Calculate 40% of the tank capacity: 0.40 * 750 gallons = 300 gallons.
2.  This means 300 gallons have been used.
3.  Divide the amount used by the flow rate to find the time: 300 gallons / 150 GPM = 2 minutes.

So, the correct answer should be 2 minutes. I need to adjust the options or the question to make '3 minutes' the correct answer if I want to stick to my original thought.

Let's adjust the question slightly to make 3 minutes the answer, or adjust the options.
If the answer is 3 minutes, then 3 * 150 GPM = 450 gallons used.
450 gallons used out of 750 gallons.
450 / 750 = 45 / 75 = 9 / 15 = 3 / 5 = 0.60 or 60%.
So, if the question asked 'how many minutes until the tank is 60% empty?', the answer would be 3 minutes.

Let's rephrase the question to target 3 minutes as the answer.

  "question": "Engine 3 arrives on scene with a 500-gallon water tank. The crew deploys a 1.75-inch attack line flowing at 150 GPM and a 2.5-inch supply line flowing at 200 GPM to protect an exposure. If they operate both lines simultaneously for 45 seconds before establishing a positive water source, how many gallons of water will remain in Engine 3's tank?",
  "options": [
    "A) 212.5 gallons",
    "B) 237.5 gallons",
    "C) 262.5 gallons",
    "D) 287.5 gallons"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "C) 262.5 gallons",
  "explanation": "First, calculate the total GPM: 150 GPM + 200 GPM = 350 GPM. Next, convert 45 seconds to a fraction of a minute: 45 seconds / 60 seconds = 0.75 minutes. Then, calculate the total water used: 350 GPM * 0.75 minutes = 262.5 gallons. Finally, subtract the water used from the initial tank capacity: 500 gallons - 262.5 gallons = 237.5 gallons remaining. \n\nWait, I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me re-evaluate. \nTotal GPM = 150 + 200 = 350 GPM.\nTime = 45 seconds = 0.75 minutes.\nWater used = 350 GPM * 0.75 min = 262.5 gallons.\nWater remaining = 500 gallons - 262.5 gallons = 237.5 gallons.\n\nMy correct answer and explanation do not match. Let me adjust the options or the correct answer to reflect the calculation. I need to make sure the correct answer matches the explanation.

Let's re-calculate and ensure the options are distinct and one is correct based on the calculation.
Total GPM = 150 GPM + 200 GPM = 350 GPM.
Time = 45 seconds = 0.75 minutes.
Water used = 350 GPM * 0.75 minutes = 262.5 gallons.
Water remaining = 500 gallons (initial tank) - 262.5 gallons (used) = 237.5 gallons.

So the correct answer should be 237.5 gallons. I need
